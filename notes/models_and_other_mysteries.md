In order to be able to utilize the term further, I need to introduce a at least somewhat share working definition of models.


# Business Perspective - Mayr et.al. (2020)
According to [Mayr et.al.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/346471466_The_triptych_of_conceptual_modeling):
utilizing the further definitions: 
### Concept:
A Concept is a mental construct formed by mentally com- bining characteristics of general or abstract ideas gained by cognition. It is seen as a pair of an intension and its extension. The intension describes the concept as such, the extension consists of all objects that might be used as an example for the intension. This definition is based on [22] (a concept is “something conceived in the mind”), Word- net [24] (“an abstract or general idea inferred or derived from specific instances”), and the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy2 (“concepts are constituents of thoughts”), [3, 25, 26].

### Notion: 
A Notion is a general inclusive concept in which some confidence is placed; i.e., a notion is a specific kind of concept.3 This definition is based on Wordnet (“a notion is a general understanding, vague idea or a general inclusive concept in which some confidence is placed”) and [22] who propose “arriving at the notion of law” as an example for the interpretation of notion as a general inclusive concept.

### Term:
A Term is an item of a (possibly formal) language formed for denoting, designating, or naming something. “Lan- guage” is understood here in a very broad sense, i.e., it can be textual, graphical but also material. Terms can refer to concepts and/or represent them for recognition by linguistic perception processes, i.e., processes mapping a
term/symbol to a mental object. Note that this interpretation of term is inspired by one of the definitions given in [22] (“a pronounceable series of letters having a distinct meaning especially in a particular field”), but differs from others


## 1. General Model:
*A model is the synthesis of a conceptual idea, a form of expression and the assumption of a role through which it fulfils a function.*

Thereby a model is determined by the following characteristics:
### 1.1 Models are related to (a collection) of “origins” or “originals”
A model is a model of something, i.e., it is a proxy of a natural, artificial, or mental original; in particular, the original of a model may be a model itself. 
As originals may change in time, the model/original relationship may change in time as well.
Models are results of cognitive processes (perception) . 
The mission of a model is that of transporting a “cargo,” namely the perceived properties of the original that are considered to be relevant within the perception’s context. 
Mahr sees this function as the key criterion for a “model being a model”. The transport occurs with the usage of the model; 
precision and transport warranties distinguish models and metaphor.

### 1.2 Concern and usage

The authors there distinguish between three different main **concerns** that are coupled to most kinds of modeling: 
- (1) understanding 
- (2) communicating 
- (3) agreeing as a process of consolidation, manifestation, and consensus.


*We place models between ourselves as perceiving, recognizing, understanding, judging or acting subjects 
and the world as perceptible, observable, effective, to be judged or produced exterior. The impact of models results from the role that models play through their transport function in work pro- cesses, cognitive processes, business processes*

### 1.3 Purpose and Function
Given its concern and usage, a model serves a particular purpose: to understand/analyze/assess the origin, to plan/design a new original, to explain or predict properties of the original, to communicate about perceptions and ideas, and similar. The usage determines the function(s) of a model, for example to support explanation. It therefore makes sense to see a model’s function as that of an “instrument”


### 1.4 Domain and Context
For the concerns of modeling, the authors distinguish the following three domains:
(a) the domain of interest, experience, and perspective of a human,
(b) the application domain or world domain to which a community of practice refers,
(c) the domain of discourse among some particular people.

### 1.5 Focus
A model reflects, for a given purpose, the “relevant” but not all aspects of its origin(al). In particular, “The objectual properties may recede behind the consideration of their rational-functional relationships”

### 1.6 Representation
 For communication/transportation purposes, a model needs an associated “physical” representation; examples are an acoustic signal, a toy railroad, a diagram, a XML statement, an OWL file, a spoken/written natural language text, and so forth. These representations allow models to be recognized and under- stood by communication partners; in the case of a human partner, recognition is enhanced by “linguistic perception”

## 2. Conceptual models
In order to create a clear understanding, the framework for a general model definition from above will be used.
In addition, two new characteristics have been added.

### 2.1 Models are related to (a collection) of “origins” or “originals”
No need for differentiation in conceptual modelling.

### 2.2  Concern and usage
Here can be said: 
Conceptual modeling has a strong (although not mandatory) orientation to a **subsequent implementation/realization of artifacts or products**.

### 2.3 Purpose and function
As a consequence of extending the concern, the authors supplement the purpose “plan/design a new original” with “plan/design/realize.

### 2.4 Domain and Context
There is no principal limitation regarding domains and contexts of con- ceptual modeling so that also this characteristic provides no hard criterion for differentiation. 
However, in practice, conceptual modeling has been mainly used so far in domains and contexts that deal with discrete objects (things, actions), their properties and relationships. Again, however, this is no strong criterion for differentiation.


### 2.5 Focus
Conceptual models have no noteworthy peculiarity regarding this general model characteristic. In practice, however, their focus has been mainly on aspects that can be realized or implemented.

### 2.6 Representation
Conceptual models transport semantics by terms that denote concepts. 
As terms are elements of languages, conceptual modeling **uses linguistic representations**
in the broadest sense: these may originate from a diagrammatic language (e.g., ER diagrams), 
a natural language, an artificial language (e.g., XML), a mathematical or formal language(e.g., Petri nets in the sense of 
algebraic structures). Such languages provide a set of literals and a set of rules for composing literals to terms, terms to phrases, 
phrases to sentences, and so on. If the members of a certain community of practice have agreed on the meaning of terms or patterns and their combination, 
they can infer from these to the transported concepts.

### 2.7 Concept Space
From its beginnings, conceptual modeling had a strong relation to semantics. Partly, “semantic modeling” using terms that are associated with concepts from a “concept space” is even used as a synonym of conceptual modeling:
A community of practice agrees on the terms and concepts, which it will consider, as well as on the association between these terms and concepts, and thus establishes an instrument for communication. The terms used for representing models thus have a meaning, the “a priori semantic”.

### 2.8 Concept relationship
Concepts can be related to each other. Typical concept relationships are the “abstractions” Mereology (Aggregation),
Generalization, and Intension, each of them having an inverse: Dis-assembly (into components), Specialization (by additional concept attributes), Extension (denominating the elements characterized by their intension concept).
Other concept relationships are, e.g., synonymy, homonymy, troponymy, hyponymy; however, these only concern the level of assigning linguistic denoters to concepts.
