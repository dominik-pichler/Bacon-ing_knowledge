# What is Chaos and where does it begin?
What happens when we know to little? At least in my world, too little information leads to unpredictability of the systems around me, also defined as chaos: 

 
 > The original ancient Greek word chaos (χαος) refers to the shapeless primordial mass from which the earth (ancient Greek Gaia or Γαια) emerged. Today, we generally understand chaos to be a disorganised state that is difficult to predict; we speak of "traffic chaos", for example. While this image describes the interaction of many traffic participants, which in chaos theory correspond to many degrees of freedom, it has recently been shown that systems with few degrees of freedom, such as a periodically driven pendulum, can also exhibit chaotic time behaviour. This means that its angular position as a function of time becomes irregular and unpredictable in the long term (Fig. 1a). This type of chaos is called deterministic chaos.

But where does predictability end and chaos begin? How little information is too little to predict systems? Modern chaos-theory offers at least some kind of structure to identify this point on which predictability comes to a (sudden) halt. For a system to become chaotic, commonly speaking the following criteria have to be met: 

1. **Sensitive Dependence on Initial Conditions**:<br> Even in deterministic systems, small differences in initial conditions can lead to vastly different outcomes. This phenomenon is often referred to as the "butterfly effect," where a minor change, such as the flap of a butterfly's wings, can ultimately cause a tornado elsewhere. This sensitivity makes long-term prediction impossible, even though the system is deterministic. 

2. **Complexity and Overfitting**: <br>In complex systems, adding more variables or increasing the complexity of models does not necessarily improve predictability. Instead, it can lead to overfitting, where a model becomes too tailored to past data and fails to predict future outcomes accurately.  

3. **Chaotic Dynamics**: <br> Systems that exhibit chaotic behavior are predictable only for short periods. The predictability diminishes as time progresses due to the exponential increase in uncertainty. This is characterized by the Lyapunov time, which defines how long a system remains predictable before becoming chaotic. 

4. **Intrinsic Unpredictability**: <br>Some systems are inherently unpredictable due to their chaotic nature. This unpredictability is not due to randomness but rather the complex interplay of deterministic laws that govern the system's dynamics.
   
5. **Measurement Limitations**: <br>The inability to measure initial conditions with perfect accuracy further contributes to unpredictability. Even minute measurement errors can lead to significant deviations in predictions over time. In summary, predictable systems become unpredictable when they exhibit chaotic behavior, sensitive dependence on initial conditions, and when complexity or measurement limitations prevent accurate long-term forecasting.
