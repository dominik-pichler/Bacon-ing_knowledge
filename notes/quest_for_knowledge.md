### Dawkins Memes:
Dawkins coined the term "meme" in his 1976 book "The Selfish Gene" to describe a unit of cultural transmission or imitation. He proposed that just as genes propagate themselves in the gene pool by leaping from body to body via sperm or eggs, so too do memes propagate themselves in the "meme pool" by leaping from brain to brain.


Dawkins defined a meme as a "unit of cultural transmission" - any idea, behavior, skill, or other phenomenon that gets passed from person to person by means of imitation, teaching, or other forms of social transmission. Examples of memes given by Dawkins include tunes, ideas, catchphrases, fashion, and the technology of building arches.


Dawkins saw memes as analogous to genes in their capacity to replicate, mutate, and respond to selective pressures. He hypothesized that memes evolve by a process of variation, mutation, competition, and inheritance, in a way similar to the evolution of biological organisms. 

Dawkins believed that the meme is the cultural equivalent of the gene, and is just as essential to understanding human culture and evolution as the gene is to understanding biological evolution
